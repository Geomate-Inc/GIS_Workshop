Doing this tells the plugin that we want to create our web map using the Leaflet JavaScript library, instead of the *OpenLayers* or *Mapbox GL* ones. These different web mapping libraries are good at different things when it comes to creating web maps, and should be one of the first things you consider when you begin developing a web map on your own. For our purposes, we are using Leaflet because it is lightweight and the code is easy to understand, if you so choose to explore the scripts behind the web map we are making today. \n",
