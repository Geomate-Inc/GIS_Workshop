In QGIS, like in the image below, find the *XYZ Tiles* and click and drag the *OpenStreetMap* layer into the *Layers* window. If you find that the basemap is being shown over your traffic collision layers, you can reorder your layers so that the basemap is at the bottom of your *Layers* list. "

To get a new basemap in QGIS, we need to access the tile servers for basemaps, and a variety of them can be found here: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers\n",

For the URL, paste the URL of your chosen basemap from the Tile servers page, and remove the $ symbols. You can adjust the zoom levels if you want, but the defaults are usually appropriate. Click *OK*, and click and drag the new XYZ Tiles connection in your *Layers* list. \n",

    "You'll find that you can't see your basemap underneath your traffic collisions layer, other than toggling the layer on and off. We can remedy this by making the traffic collisions layer semi-transparent. Open the *Properties* of the traffic collisions layer and go to the *Symbology* tab. At the bottom of the window, check out the *Layer Rendering* options, and you will see you can adjust the *Opacity* of the layer. Set the *Opacity* to 80\\% and hit *OK*. Now we can see the basemap through the traffic collisions layer! When you preview your web map, you will see that all of that changes we've made in QGIS are reflected in the web map. "
