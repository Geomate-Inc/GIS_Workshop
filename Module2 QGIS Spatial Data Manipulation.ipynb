    "This introductory module will get you started with using the basic tools of QGIS. We will investigate components of the user-interface and learn how to load in both pre-made geospatial files as well as non-geospatial data to convert into geospatial data. Finally we will explore the filter capabilities within QGIS that allow for manipulation of the geospatial data. The learning objectives of this module are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identiy key components of the QGIS user-interface (i.e. dropdown menus, toolbox locations, and simple buttons)\n",
    "2. Use QGIS to load geospatial data files and visualize the data\n",
    "3. Experiment with projection systems to understand how it impacts visualization of your data\n",
    "4. Use QGIS to load in non-geospatial data and convert it to spatial data in order to visualize the data\n",
    "5. Generate simple queries in order to select specific entries from a larger data set\n"

Projects make it easy to save, close, and resume your work from where you left off as the paths to your geospatial data is saved and there is no need to reload your data. **CAUTION: If you move your geospatial data to a new folder you will need to reset the paths as QGIS will not keep track of moving data**"

Make sure that the format is set to ESRI Shapefile and save it in a location that you will remember. Next click on the projection button (it looks like a globe with a plane overlain on it), filter the projections by searching for WGS 84 / Arctic Polar Stereographic.
