This website allows access to both spatial and non-spatial data from the City of Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge, and other towns within the region. We have selected a few datasets to use for the different modules that make up this workshop. These data are stored in the ModuleData folder on github. This folder contains subfolders for each module exercise with access to the data and a short description of each dataset as well as where it was originally downloaded. Make sure you download this data and store it in a folder you will be able to easily find on your computer. We will refer to this directory as the 'working directory' throughout the modules."

    "For the final module of the workshop we will be exploring the use of advanced GIS analysis through python coding. This will require the use of python and Anaconda. In order to speed up the installation of these software we will be using the minimalist Anaconda package - Miniconda. This can be downloaded from: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html (see image below). Ensure that you install the Python 3.7 version. Further information regarding python/Miniconda/GIS integration will be discussed in the final module and we will introduce some basic skills such as python package installation and syntax."
