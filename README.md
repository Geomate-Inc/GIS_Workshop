# Communitech Data Hub Workshop: Geographic Information Systems

Delivered by Nastaran Saberi, Justin Murfitt, and Q Chen

December 10, 2019

This workshop is designed to provide a beginners look into the world of GIS analysis with a focus on free and
open-source software such as QGIS. The workshop will be broken down by modules with instructions in the different
jupyter notebooks available in this repository. 

The modules that will be covered are:
1) Introduction to GIS
2) Introduction to QGIS and Spatial Data Manipulation
3) Geospatial Analysis using Vector Data
4) Web Maps
5) Advanced Geospatial Applications

The data for this workshop is sourced from the Region of Waterloo open data library, which included data from the
City of Waterloo, Kitchener, and Cambridge as well as other towns in the surronding area. This workshop is primarily
geared towards users of transportation datasets, such as road networks, traffic calming measures, and traffic collisions.
The skills taught in the workshop will focus on introductory and basic skills to serve as a jumping off point for
further analysis in the field of GIS.

# How to use this Repistory

This respository includes a series of markdown jupyter notebook files, these files serve as organized way of distributing
instructions and information that easily allow you to revisit steps and components from previous modules. The data produced 
in each section will be used in the next (i.e. results from module 1 will be used in module 2).
